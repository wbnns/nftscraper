# NFT Scraper

A proof of concept for a web scraper that could potentially interact with an NFT
marketplace. Before using a scraper on a website, be sure to check their Terms
of Service (ToS) to make sure it's allowed.

## Acknowledgements

This POC would not be possible without the work of **Zayne**. It is entirely
based on code from one of his tutorials about how to [build a web scraper with
Ruby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3CLEUBdWwQ).
